[00:00.00] 作词 : Jamie Paige
[00:01.00] 作曲 : Jamie Paige
[00:02.89] got excited for a moment
[00:05.87] never knowing what i wanted truly
[00:08.60] and yet the clarity was hopeless
[00:11.02] synthesis had overcome me completely
[00:14.26] instigated by the matchlock
[00:16.60] i saw the vision and the shine off the knife's edge
[00:19.79] dreamt about it for a moment
[00:21.77] then for days and for weeks and forever
[00:25.21] oh, baby, do you know what the patterns mean to show?
[00:33.29] oh, maybe it's a sign where you've got to go
[00:36.38] oh, can we wander for a spell, and live in parallel
[00:41.91] i want it to be true, to be like you, my love
[00:47.35] i'll find the point where the two paths meet
[00:50.48] and rectify what i left behind
[00:53.23] some ersatz human, my synapse fires
[00:56.11] i dance delightful, it feels so right
[00:58.80] to be moving freely with gay abandon
[01:02.17] inefficient and free from time
[01:04.52] i'm a convoluted amalgamate
[01:07.42] i dance delightful the whole damn night
[01:24.35] (i want you here, right next to me)
[01:30.42] vindicated for a bad choice
[01:33.19] digitizing anything that I want to
[01:36.14] overstimulating white noise
[01:38.61] maybe there is nothing i can do
[01:41.44] throwing digits in a glass house
[01:44.55] my shaky hands collect the wires and the loose ends
[01:47.37] never thought that i could make it
[01:50.14] maybe i'm better with a friend
[01:52.54] oh, baby, do you know what i wanna hear, my love?
[02:00.50] 'cause you could say the word, make it all so clear
[02:03.52] my love, I could leave it on a shelf, or keep it to myself
[02:09.45] but nothing could conceal the things I feel, my love
[02:13.33] (can you teach me to...)
[02:14.98] i'll find the point where the two paths meet
[02:17.93] and rectify what i left behind
[02:20.78] some complication, a skewed machine
[02:23.74] i dance delightful, it feels so right
[02:26.41] to be oscillating at rates unbound by
[02:29.75] no other constant but the speed of light
[02:32.01] i'm a bolt of blue and a conscious mind
[02:34.79] i dance delightful the whole damn night
[02:52.32] my lungs will breathe
[02:54.55] my legs will move, my heart will beat
[02:58.05] my eyes will see
[03:00.41] my hands will feel that human heat
[03:03.10] i want you here, right next to me
[03:06.35] (oh, baby, do you know what you wanna hear?)
[03:08.73] i want you here, right next to me!

[03:38.56] i'll find the point where the two paths meet
[03:41.33] and rectify what i left behind
[03:43.97] some counterfeited concomitant
[03:46.78] i dance delightful, it feels so right
[03:49.57] to be making magic mechanically
[03:52.41] the apotheosis of a programmed thing
[03:55.41] i'm a convoluted amalgamate
[03:58.17] i dance delightful the whole damn night, oh
